Created with Processing in 2022. 

In this artwork, the intersecting lines are arranged to create a moir√© effect, evoking a sense of dynamic movement and optical illusion. The juxtaposition of strokes against a background serves to intensify the visual impact.
What sets this work apart is its interactivity; viewers can control the movement of lines and visual effects with the mouse, allowing for a personalized exploration of the nuances of the work.
It was created with Processing (object-oriented programming language based on Java, for designers and visual artists).


Through the interplay of color, line thickness and spacing, the work invites contemplation of perception and perspective, prompting reflection on the complexities of visual interpretation. By integrating elements of randomness and interactivity, the work offers a fluidity that reflects the changing nature of human perception.
